=========
the letters are designed in inkscape to fit in a square,
they are individually exported - after quantization of the bezier curves - in dxf files,
each dxf file is imported in openScad, extruded, aligned with a separate axis, and the intersection of the shapes is taken.
after minimal adjustments - to improve aesthetic and to ensure printability - an stl is exported, and it is sliced via Slic3r with a 15% infill.
